# Setting up Codesniffer

This guide will explain the steps needed to setup Code Sniffer with Drupal coding standards and PhpStorm.

**IMPORTANT!** You need brew to perform this task, http://brew.sh/

1. Install code sniffer

  ```sh
  brew install php-code-sniffer
  ```
2. Download [Drupal Coder Module](https://drupal.org/project/coder)

  Make sure you are in your home dir

  ```
  cd
  ```

  ```
  wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/coder-7.x-2.1.tar.gz
  ```

  If you don't have wget install it using _brew install wget_

3. Unpack Coder module. I place it in ~/.drupal-coder

  ```
  tar -xzf coder-7.x-2.1.tar.gz
  mv coder .drupal-coder
  rm coder-7.x-2.1.tar.gz
  ```

4. Create symlink to Drupals code standards.

  Brew installs Code Sniffer into _/usr/local/Cellar/php-code-sniffer/1.5.2/_
  We want a symlink pointing at Drupals code standards in _/usr/local/Cellar/php-code-sniffer/1.5.2/CodeSniffer/Standards/_

  ```
  ln -s ~/.drupal-coder/coder_sniffer/Drupal /usr/local/Cellar/php-code-sniffer/1.5.2/CodeSniffer/Standards/Drupal
  ```

  **Important** Make sure you change _.drupal-coder_ in the above if you did not install coder in the suggested folder.

## Configure PhpStorm

1. Tell PhpStorm where to find Code Sniffer

  1. Go to Preferences -> PHP -> Code Sniffer

  2. Paste this into PHP Code Sniffer (phpcs) path: **_/usr/local/bin/phpcs_**

  3. Validate and apply

2. Enable Code Sniffer inspection

  1. Go to Preferences -> Inspections -> PHP -> PHP Code Sniffer validation

  2. Enable this

  3. Refresh coding standards, Drupal should pop up

  4. Apply and OK


You should be ready to go. Open a Drupal module and make a coding style error to be sure.
